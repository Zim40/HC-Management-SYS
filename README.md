# About HC-Management System

HC-Management System is a user-friendly application designed to streamline time tracking and employee management processes. Whether you're an employee or an administrator, our platform offers intuitive features to enhance efficiency and productivity in your workplace.

## For Employees

Employees can easily access the system to log their working hours by simply clocking in and out. Additionally, they have the convenience of accessing their own profiles to review their time records stored securely in the database.

## For Administrators

Admin users play a pivotal role in overseeing the system and managing user accounts effectively. By selecting the Admin role during registration, administrators gain control over account creation, ensuring that only authorized personnel can register new accounts. They have the capability to view all registered users and access comprehensive attendance logs.
